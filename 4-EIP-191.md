### EIP-191 
defines a standard for signing messages in a way that can be easily validated. It establishes a specific format for messages signed **off-chain**, helping to ensure that the signature is valid and the message has not been altered.

#### Key Points:
- Personal Signing: Used for signing data off-chain, such as when a user wants to prove ownership of an address without making a transaction.
- Special Prefix: Adds a special prefix to the message, like **"\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n"**, followed by the length of the message. This ensures that the signed message is unique and cannot be confused with a regular transaction.
- Security: Prevents signed messages from being maliciously reused in different contexts.

#### Openzeppelin tool that hepl us with this
**MessageHashUtils**
```solidity 
import { MessageHashUtils } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/MessageHashUtils.sol";
```
> 📝In summary,<br> EIP-191 enhances the security of off-chain signatures, making it harder for signed messages to be misused.
